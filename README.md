# cubic-halin-graphs
A Halin graph on n vertices and m edges is a graph that is planar, 3-connected, and has a face whose number of vertices equals m-n+1.
A cubic graph is a graph with every vertex of degree 3.

This repository contains cubic Halin graphs up to 32 vertices.

YΔ graphs are graphs which arise from the Y→Δ transformations from the complete graph K4.
That is, the set of YΔ graphs is the smallest set that satisfies
- K4 is a YΔ graph.
- If X contains a triangle and contracting the triangle yields a YΔ graph, then X is a YΔ graph.

This repository contains YΔ graph up to 26 vertices.

All the graphs are in the graph6 format.

Theorems:
- Every YΔ graph is cubic and planar.
- Every cubin Halin graph is a YΔ graph.
